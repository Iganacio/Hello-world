Hello World


I'm going to tell a little story, my little story.

Not someone else's, but mine.

My story of why at the age of 28 I am determined to change my career.

Since my childhood I have wanted to be a doctor, like my mother, until in high school I came across the subject of Biology.

I hated it.

I loved Math, I loved Physics and Chemistry but I hate Biology.

So I decided to be an Engineer.

After 6 years and obtaining a degree and a master's degree in chemical engineering, I was still not very convinced.

I went to Ireland for a year to improve my English.

Then I started working and finally, I started to be sure.

Not really.

At 23 years old you cannot be sure of anything in life.

I became interested in programming but I did not consider it more than one more tool.

Over time I was doing more and more complex things in VBA.

More things and more complex.

Until one day I came across this interview on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAh97kg48A
In just over two hours I discovered what I wanted to do, I wanted to work with data. My eternal thanks to Guillemo Barquero and Eduardo Riera.

I had never seen something so powerful, with so many possibilities and that I could study at home.

If you want it you can do it, but that is the difficult thing.

Everyone can do it.

Few people really want it.

In September 2020 I start studying 60 hours a week.

No 10.

Neither 20 or 40.

60 hours a week.

I really wanted.

I started with Python learning how to handle the most common libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, Keras or TensorFlow.
After I started with Machine learning where I programmed linear and polynomial regressions, neural networks, decision trees, KNN, SVM, recommenders and even convolutional networks and natural language processing (NLP).

And then I begin to practice it and practice it more and more. The result of my work is on my Kaggle and GitHub pages.

I assure you that you can only dedicate 60 hours a week to something if you really love it.

It is never too late to start studying something new.

If I could only give two tips they would be:

- Be curious. Read a lot.

- Work every day and be patient to find the result.

Good luck
