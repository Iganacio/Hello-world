Hello World

I'm going to tell a little story, my little story.
Not someone else's.
If not mine.
My story of why at the age of 28 I am determined to change my career.
Since my childhood, I have wanted to be a doctor like my mother, until in high school I came across the subject of Biology.
I hated her.
I loved Math, Physics and Chemistry. Biology, no.
So I decided to be an engineer. Not very convinced either.
After 6 years and obtaining a degree and a master's degree in chemical engineering, I was still not very convinced.
I went to Ireland for a year to improve my English and I was still not very sure.
Then I started working and finally, I started to be sure.
Not really.
At 23 years old, you cannot be sure of anything in life.
I became interested in programming but I did not consider it more than one more tool.
Over time I was doing more and more complex things in VBA
More things and more complex
Until one day I came across this interview on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yAh97kg48A
In just over two hours I discovered what I wanted to be, Data Scientist. My eternal thanks to Guillemo Barquero and Eduardo Riera.
I had never seen something so powerful, with so many possibilities and that I could study at home.
At home, almost free.
Like a God, but with a computer.
If you want it you can do it, but that is the difficult thing.
Everyone can do it.
Few people really want it.
In September, my 'stroke of luck': I was off work for 3 months and had money saved. So I go to study 60 hours a week.
No 10.
Neither 20 or 40.
60 hours a week.
I really wanted.
I started with Python:
-	Python for Everybody Specialization (https://coursera.org/share/36335cc8d37cee81999c180d2adeebe0)
After that, Machine learning:
-	Machine Learning Course (https://coursera.org/share/ef43854dedff57be435b63eec4d1e37c)
-	Applied Data Science with Python Specialization (https://coursera.org/share/19f4eef41546700a3fe99e1f4daa694f)
-	DeepLearning.AI Deep Learning Specialization (https://coursera.org/share/1eb01c34426e8eb5c7ae967d2d4c81bf)
And then to practice it in Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/ignaciomorenomarn)
The most incredible thing of all is that I am only 5 years away from the person who knows the most in the world on the subject in some topics.
Only 5 years.

It is never too late to start studying something new.

LEARN, LIVE, DREAM.
